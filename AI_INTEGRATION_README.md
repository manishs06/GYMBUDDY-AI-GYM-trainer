## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Backend Components

#### AI Backend (`ai_backend/`)
- **main.py**: Flask server with AI analysis endpoints
- **body_part_angle.py**: Calculates angles between body parts
- **types_of_exercise.py**: Exercise-specific detection logic
- **utils.py**: Helper functions and utilities

#### MERN Backend (`server/`)
- **routes/ai.js**: API endpoints for AI integration
- **models/**: Database models for sessions and exercises
- **middleware/auth.js**: Authentication middleware

### Frontend Components

#### React Components (`client/src/components/`)
- **AIWorkoutSession.js**: Real-time workout session with webcam
- **ExerciseFormAnalysis.js**: Upload and analyze exercise videos/images

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Install AI Backend Dependencies

```bash
cd ai_backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Start AI Backend Server

```bash
cd ai_backend
python main.py
```

The AI backend will run on `http://localhost:8000`

### 3. Install MERN Stack Dependencies

```bash
# Install server dependencies
cd server
npm install

# Install client dependencies
cd ../client
npm install
```

### 4. Environment Variables

Create `.env` files in both `server/` and `client/` directories:

#### Server Environment (`server/.env`)
```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/gymbuddy
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000
PYTHON_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

#### Client Environment (`client/.env`)
```env
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

### 5. Start the Application

```bash
# Start MongoDB (if not running)
mongod

# Start server (in server directory)
npm start

# Start client (in client directory)
npm start
```

## üì± Usage

### Real-time AI Workout Session

1. Navigate to `/ai-workout` in the application
2. Select your exercise type
3. Click "Start Workout" to begin camera access
4. Position yourself in front of the camera
5. Perform your exercise - the AI will count reps and provide feedback
6. Click "End Workout" when finished

### Exercise Form Analysis

1. Navigate to the form analysis section
2. Select exercise type
3. Upload a video or image of your exercise
4. Click "Analyze Form" to get AI feedback
5. Review results including rep count and form quality

## üîß API Endpoints

### AI Backend Endpoints

- `GET /health` - Health check
- `POST /api/analyze-form` - Analyze uploaded exercise media
- `POST /api/real-time-analysis` - Real-time frame analysis
- `GET /api/exercise-suggestions` - Get AI exercise recommendations
- `POST /api/workout-plan` - Generate personalized workout plans

### MERN Backend Endpoints

- `POST /api/ai/analyze-form` - Proxy to AI backend
- `POST /api/ai/real-time-analysis` - Real-time analysis proxy
- `GET /api/ai/exercise-suggestions` - Exercise suggestions
- `POST /api/ai/workout-plan` - Workout plan generation
- `GET /api/ai/health` - AI backend health check

## üéØ Key Features

### Real-time Pose Detection
- Uses MediaPipe for accurate body landmark detection
- Tracks 33 body points for comprehensive pose analysis
- Provides real-time feedback on exercise form

### Exercise Counting Algorithm
- **Push-ups**: Detects arm extension and flexion cycles
- **Pull-ups**: Monitors upward and downward movements
- **Sit-ups**: Tracks torso angle changes
- **Squats**: Analyzes leg angle variations
- **Walking**: Detects step patterns

### Quality Assessment
- Form quality scoring based on exercise standards
- Real-time feedback on technique
- Repetition counting with accuracy validation

## üîç Technical Details

### AI Model Architecture
- **MediaPipe Pose**: Google's pose detection model

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Camera Access Denied**
   - Ensure browser permissions for camera access
   - Check HTTPS requirement for camera access

2. **AI Backend Connection Error**
